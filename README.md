This is the codebase of my personal website as it is is in october 2016. The base layout is a html template. I added the showcase page to show more of my work. 

I am focussing on front end techniques such as responsiveness, animation and layout. I am using html(5), CSS(3), Javascript and jQuery for this.

My next step will be handcoding a similar site all by myself.
